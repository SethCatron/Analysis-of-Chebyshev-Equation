# Analysis-of-Chebyshev-Equation
This project deals with the Chebyshev Equation, specifically finding the recurrence relation of its coefficients and determining when the power series solution becomes a polynomial. The rest of the project focuses on solving an initial value problem and approximating the solution with its Taylor polynomial. The third-degree and fourth-degree Taylor polynomials are plotted using Python.
